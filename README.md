# Ladder Game

## Concept

A very simple game, where a knight has to grab all the treasure he can find, without getting caught by the skeleton.
The game can have an infinite number of levels, just create a txt file, and design it!
If you can pass all of the levels, then you win! If you get caught, you die...
It is a multiplayer game: the knight is control with arrows keys, and the skeleton with ZQSD (Azerty version of WQSD)
